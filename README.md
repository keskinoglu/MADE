# Can Franconia's wine region now include Bamberg due to warmer weather?

Despite the negative effects of climate change, some wine varietals thrive in warmer climates. For instance, Bamberg, once a wine-producing region, could potentially regain its former status due to rising temperatures. We compare the climate of nearby Wuerzburg, at the heart of the Franconian winemaking region, to Bamberg's which is currently just outside of it.

In this project, we compare the weather patterns of Wuerzburg to Bamberg to see if the climates are similar enough for Bamberg to grow the type, quality and quantitiy of wine grapes that Wuerzburg cultivates.
